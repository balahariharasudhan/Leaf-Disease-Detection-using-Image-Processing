# 🍃 Leaf Disease Detection using Image Processing (MATLAB)

A simple MATLAB GUI system to detect leaf diseases based on color and texture features (GLCM & LBP).

# 🔍 Features
- Load and display leaf images
- Segment healthy vs. diseased regions
- Calculate disease severity
- Extract color (RGB) and texture (GLCM, LBP) features
- Save processed results and reports

# 🚀 How to Run
1. Open `leaf_disease_detection_gui.m, extract_color_feature.m, extract_texture_feature.m` as a single file in MATLAB
2. Run the file in the command prompt of MATLAB using leaf_disease_detection_gui
3. Use the GUI to load an image and process it

# 🛠 Requirements
- MATLAB (R2018 or newer)
- Image Processing Toolbox
